        <h2> My favorite place in the world is Dolly Sods. If you haven't been there, nothing is like it the world. Looking over the cliff you can see a sunset like no other. You can wander through fields taller then you and find some of the craziest looking boulders. Then if you venture in to the wood the tree are gaint, with amazing leaves and amazing bark. It is one place that seems to not have any human disturbance. </h2>
